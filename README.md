Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows is NP-hard problem which can be optimalized with many different heurestics. 
This project solve it by using two algorithms:
* [Greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm)
* [Tabu search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search)
